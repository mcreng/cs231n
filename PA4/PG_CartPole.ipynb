    "# CartPole with Policy Gradient Method\n",
    "In this exercise you will build a policy-gradient based agent that can solve the classic CartPole task where we must balance a pole on a cart for as long as possible. You will specifically be using the OpenAI Gym in order to have a reactive environment that gives you observations (state) and reward with a given action from your model. For those who are not familiar with OpenAI Gym, please check out the short [tutorial](https://gym.openai.com/docs) to cover the basics of the different game environments."
